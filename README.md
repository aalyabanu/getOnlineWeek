# Get Online Week

## Task
Design a website for the Get Online Week Campaign which is to be run from the 12th to 18th October 2020.

## Requirements
- A landing page summarising the purpose of the campaign.
- A page with more detail about the campaign and why it is important to get as many community organisations involved as possible.
- A form so a community orgranisation can register their intererst.
- A page for downloading the event resources we provide.
- A standard footer displayed on all pages in the site.

## Summary of Tech Stack
This website was built during my first introductory course on web development using HTML and CSS. I have also used bootstrap to create better looking page navigation. I deployed it on Github pages for your viewing. 

## Functionality
The website consists of a landing page consisting of hero image and brief description that summarizes the purpose of the campaign. The About Us page includes further information on the campaign and the orgnaizer.
All the downloadable resources have been included in the Downloads page. I have also included a form where organizations can get in touch to contribute to the campaing. Since the aim of this project is to improve on front-end design skills, the search bar and form entries are not funtional yet. This would be the next step of this project.
